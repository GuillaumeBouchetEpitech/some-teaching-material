# Clustering

* similar to classification
* we donâ€™t know what we are looking for
* trying to identify some segments or clusters
* unsupervised learning

## K-Means Clustering

pro(s):
- Simple to understand
- easily adaptable
- works well on small or large datasets
- fast, efficient/performant
con(s):
- Need to choose the number of clusters

## Hierarchical Clustering

pro(s)
- The optimal number of clusters can be obtained by the model itself
- practical visualization with the dendrogram
con(s)
- Not appropriate for large datasets
