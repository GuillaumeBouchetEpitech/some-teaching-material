# Clustering

* similar to classification
* we donâ€™t know what we are looking for
* trying to identify some segments or clusters
* unsupervised learning

## K-Means Clustering

Simple to understand, easily adaptable,
works well on small or large datasets,
fast, efficient and performant

Need to choose the number of clusters

## Hierarchical Clustering

The optimal number of clusters can be
obtained by the model itself, practical
visualisation with the dendrogram

Not appropriate for large datasets
